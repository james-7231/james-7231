Hello, world!
My name is James! (@james-7231)

I'm interested in learning as much as I can, since that's what makes me happy!
At this moment, I'm currently studying dynamic memory allocation (through CS50x) in C! So much fun, huh? ðŸ˜†
I plan to finish this course and try and step into a position to further my education in development.
I'm currently looking for employment, so that I can make the hobby I love into a career!
You can reach me through email (JamesTristanHill1998@gmail.com) for contact about employment, colaboration, etc..
